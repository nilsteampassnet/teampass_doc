# Authentication

In order to access Teampass Items, a User has to be allowed to get connected. A User is authenticated through the usage of a `Login` and a `Password`.

The `Password` is encrypted in the database using Crypt feature which generates a hashed string using the standard Unix DES-based algorithm. The `Salt` used to generate this hash is obtained randomly with `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes` function.

It can be secured through usage of dedicated options defined here below.

# Normal access

As written previously, the initial level of authentication relies on the paired `Login` and `Password`. This means that the user needs to indicate his credentials to get connected.

	Note that 3 wrong attempts will disable the login feature for a period of 10 seconds.

# Secure login with Google Two-Factor Authentication

An option permits to enable `Google Two-Factor Authentication` to complete the initial login process.

Google Two-Factor Authentication enhances login security. When logging in, a QR code is displayed, which must be scanned into the user's Google Authentication app to receive a one-time password. 

	This requires all users to have Google Authentication application on an Internet-connected mobile device.

# Secure login with DUOSecurity

## About DUOSecurity

DUOSecurity is a two-factor authentication tool securing any kind of tool requiring a user authentication. It protects every account with ease.

## How does it work with Teampass?

Once enabled, this feature will require you to synchronize the accounts in Teampass and DUOSecurity. Each Teampass user login needs to have a similar input inside DUOSecurity.

When a Teampass user will require an access to Teampass, DUOSecurity will check if he/she is allowed to access and he/she will need to confirm the access through a dedicated personal device (check the [authentication methods](https://www.duosecurity.com/product/methods)). If DUOSecurity confirms the legitimacy of the user, then Teampass will allow the user to get connected.
